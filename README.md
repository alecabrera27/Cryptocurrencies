# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

We will create a report for  a prominent investment bank, who is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers.  Our report will include what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.
The data we will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models.Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, we will use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, we’ve decided on a clustering algorithm, and we’ll create data visualizations to share our findings with the board.
